        <p>The game storyline is about a group of twelve (12) brave civilian trying to invade a city with 
            less impressive ammunition and technology in other to free the city from the military 
            who had abuse and wrongly use their power over the citizen of the city. 
            The military has twelve (12) major soldier that control the city, each of these soldier has 
            more than enough ammunition and they use the best and latest technological weapons. 
            The military force together has a strong surveillance system that moves around within 
            the city at every 30 seconds to check for intruders and spy, at every point that this 
            surveillance system or drone comes to survey the city for intruders at each position it 
            captures within the city, if there is one of these twelve 12 brave civilian (player) there, 
            an arithmetic progression question will pop out for the civilian to solve the first step of 
            the question, the purpose of the question here is that, if the civilian (player) solve the 
            first step correctly, it will act as a camouflage for the player to prevent the surveillance
            system to detect if there is an intruder at the spot. The surveillance systems come to inspect 
            for seven times, these represent the seven steps required to calculate both the nth term of an 
            arithmetic progression and the sum of nth term of an arithmetic progression. 
            The game is designed to be an 8-by-8 grid checkers board, which has twenty four pieces, 
            twelve of the pieces represent the twelve military soldier and the other twelve represent the 
            twelve brave civilian (player). Each player piece is moved by the student (player) based on the 
            rules of the traditional checkers, which can only move in the upward direction, either up-left 
            or up-right position and moving backward is not possible here, unless it a move to eliminate one 
            of the opponent piece (military soldier). Also the opponent pieces works the same way as the
            player piece only in the opposite direction. Every time the surveillance system comes to check,
            it comes with a time duration (ts) apart from the general countdown time (tg), each of the 
            steps for solving these arithmetic progression has its own fixed point (pf), if the player is 
            able to solve the each step of the question correctly, the actual time he/she uses to calculate 
            each step is represent by (tu), the actual point for each step (p1 to p7) will be gotten by 
            dividing the fixed point (pf) by the actual time used to calculate the step (tu). Using this 
            logic, the sum of p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6 and p7 will result to the player’s point of the entire 
            game, if the player’s calculation is incorrect the point for the step result to zero, and the
            game return to start. Each user point are stored and displayed and ranked in the scoreboard page, where different users can see what position they fall into, this will prompt them to keep playing
            therefore resulting to mastering the learning processes for
            solving arithmetic progression. A worksheet is shown to the user at the completion of the game 
            which shows the step by step solution of the arithmetic progression question being asked in the 
            game. In order for the player to advance past that point, the game needs to provide them a tip or
            a notion of what they will experience. Since the game has an efficient feedback system that helps 
            the player comprehend and react to the game in a way that allows them to advance while navigating 
            the game. At the end of the game each user’s (player) score is stored in the database at the first play and get
            updated if there is a score greater than the initial highest score.</p>
